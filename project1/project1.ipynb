    "Widely regarded as the all-time greatest players in the history of the NBA, Michael Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to six championships (1991-93 and 1996-98). The other constants during the 1991-1998 Bulls era were hall of famer Scottie Pipen and coach Phil Jackson. We would like to study whether Jordan's presence on the team was (statistically) significant in bringing the championships to the Bulls. <br>\n",
    "Conveniently (for us), Jordan retired from basketball after winning three consecutive NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He retired ahead of the 1994 season but returned back from retirement late during the 1995 season to eventually lead the Bulls to three more titles in the 1996, 1997, 1998 seasons. <br>\n",
    "During his absence, both Pipen and Jackson were still at the Bulls, allowing us to study the impact of Michael Jordan's absence on the Chicago Bulls' performance. This fact will allow us to assume that the only change in the years with or without Jordan in the period 1992-1997 was Michael Jordan's presence/absence. You may assume there are no other confounding factors at play."
